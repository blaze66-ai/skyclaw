# SKYCLAW 🦞

SKYCLAW is an autonomous AI agent framework focused on **controlled execution** and **multi-agent orchestration**.

This project explores the architecture for self-hosted AI agents that can operate securely and predictably.  
Early experiments are being conducted, and the core runtime logic is under active development.

Built on the OpenClaw ecosystem.
